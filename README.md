oh my god, just saw Last Bullet and my head’s still spinning like a raccoon on a Ferris wheel. Couldn’t tell where the movie ended and reality began, plus this damn popcorn kernel is stuck in my teeth - a battle I can’t win. The opening scene was a zap to the brain, soldiers marching like they own gravity. The theater lights were too bright, someone behind me kept whispering. pulsating music like a heartbeat. You feel that?

> The plot twisted more than a drunk octopus, and that sniper - whoo! - looked like my Uncle Rick on target practice day, but with less beard and more angst. When the dog died, you know, I felt like my heart was being ripped out by a teaspoon? Or maybe it was just the caffeine. My thoughts are moshed together like a salad of raw emotions and buttery smells. Wait, wasn’t I supposed to download the movie for later? Someone asked, I think. Or was it watch the movie again? Can’t remember.

The villain though, what a cliche! every line like they were reading out of a How to be Evil booklet, yet somehow it worked? Like putting hot sauce on ice cream, weirdly good. But oh, the gunfights! They were like fireworks on the Fourth of July... are my ears ringing or is it this damn internal buzzing?

Sort of like how my back aches right now. Theater seats were designed by someone who hates spines. In the end, the protagonist’s realization was as predictable as my cat’s disdain for vacuum cleaners. Yet I’m left dazed, like I stepped into a wind tunnel of testosterone and slow-mo explosions.

Python…? Feels like my fingers slipped into something else...
```python
def final_reflection(bullet, theatre):
    while movie_over:
        confused += 1
    return popcorn // emotion
```
